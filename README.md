# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a large, imbalanced dataset of over 1.8 million rows. Built as part of a university machine learning course, it applies real-world data preprocessing, resampling techniques, and model evaluation to tackle the challenges of fraud detection.
